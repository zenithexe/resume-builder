# Resume Builder

I was looking for a project idea to showcase on my Resume, and hence came up with the resume builder. lol
Also it was a good project to learn the redux-toolkit. 

**Library use :**

`redux-toolkit` : state-management

`shadcn` : ui components

`react-component-export-image` : exporting to png

---
### Local Installation :

1. Clone the Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/zenithexe/resume-builder
```
2. Install the required npm packages:
```
npm i
```
3. Run on live server:
```
npm run dev
```

---
#### Note :
Since the project uses `html2canvas` library to export the Resume to PNG, it various of the window size and might be buggy in Tablet Devices.
