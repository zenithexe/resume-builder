# Resume Builder

I was looking for a project idea to showcase on my Resume, and hence came up with the resume builder. lol
Also it was a good project to learn the redux-toolkit. 

## Features
- Developed a dynamic Resume Builder application using React.js to allow users to create and customize their resumes.
- Implemented state management using React hooks and redux-tooklit for efficient data handling and seamless user experience.
- Developed a preview feature enabling users to visualize their resume before finalizing and downloading it as a PDF.
